        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of Migos, Quavo has been featured on several Billboard Hot 100
          top 10 hits, including Post Malone's "Congratulations"—which was
          certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America
          (RIAA)—as well as DJ Khaled's "No Brainer" and "I'm the One", the
          latter of which peaked at number one on the chart.[2][3] In 2018, he
          released his debut solo album Quavo Huncho, which peaked at number 2
          on the Billboard 200.

          <h2>Career</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Quavious Keyate Marshall was born on April 2, 1991, in Athens,
          Georgia.[4][5][6][7] The three members of Migos grew up together in
          Gwinnett County, a mostly suburban area 20-30 minutes northeast of
          Atlanta.[8] Quavo attended Berkmar High School and was the starting
          quarterback of its football team during the 2009 season, his senior
          year.[8] Berkmar went in the 2009 season, and Quavo went 19-of-25 for
          201 yards and three touchdowns for the first win of the season.[9][10]
          Quavo previously held the record by completing 28 passes in a game
          back in 2009 until being surpassed by Taylor Heinicke.[11] Despite
          finishing the football season for his senior year, Quavo dropped out
          of Berkmar months before graduation.

          <h2>Acting</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          In October 2022, a possible disbandment of Migos became the subject of
          speculation based on reports that Quavo's ex-girlfriend Saweetie had
          slept with Offset.[26] Following this, Quavo and Takeoff formed a
          super duo, Unc & Phew and went on to release a collaborative album
          titled Only Built for Infinity Links on October 7, 2022 without
          Offset's input.[27] During an interview with the Big Facts podcast,
          Quavo stated that he would like to see his and Takeoff's career "as a
          duo".[28][29]

        <p>
          Quavo along with the members of Migos made his TV debut after an
          appearance on an episode of Donald Glover's series Atlanta. The
          episode aired on September 13, 2016, under the title "Go For
          Broke".[37] He also made a cameo appearance on the "Dreamers" episode
          of fox's musical drama television series Star in 2018.[38]
